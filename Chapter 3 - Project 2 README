Project 2: Book rep Customer relations Management 
difficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

This project updates the CRM HTML page you started in Project 2.2 to add some visual style and make it look professional.
Instructions

1. Use your lab02-project02.html file from the last chapter as a starting point (and rename it) 
or take our chapter03-project01.html starting point file.

2. Import your existing reset.css from Project 1 to reset all default styles.

3. Create an external style sheet named chapter03-project02.css and import as well.

4. Add styles to chapter03-project02.css so that it looks similar to that shown inFigure 3.32. 
   Do not modify the markup within the <body> element. This means defining styles for the header, footer, section, 
   and other tags.
   
Hint: Notice the backgrounds for each of the section headers. Use attribute selectors for the mail and 
telephone link icons as shown below:

a[href^="mailto"] {
background: url(images/email.png) no-repeat 0 3px; 
padding-left: 1em;
}
a[href^="tel"] {
background: url(images/call.png) no-repeat 0 3px;
padding-left: 1em; }

Testing

1. Visually compare your output to that shown in Figure 3.32.
